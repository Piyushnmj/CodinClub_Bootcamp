STEP 1:
Create a folder and a sub-folder named Backup and Main in the Desktop.

STEP 2:
We have 4 files add.java, sub.py, multiply.js and division.html.
First let us program a script add.java.
For this we need to filter all the specific files present in the given folder.
example- add.java

STEP 3:
Find a name of extension of the file and create a folder with the file extension name.
example- folder created "Java". 

STEP 4:
Find a name of that file and create a sub-folder within the extension folder name.
example- "Java/add"

STEP 5:
Move the file into that specific sub-folder
example- "Java/add/add.java"

STEP 6:
Repeat step 2 to step 5 for all the other files.
